Animated Gradient Progress Bar:

The fgColor (foreground color) is now a cool #4FD1C5 (teal) that transitions smoothly in the gradient.
The progress bar also has a glowing and animated pulse effect using framer-motion, which will draw attention to the progress and make it feel more dynamic.
Glow Effect:


Added a glowing, soft border around the progress bar. This is achieved using the motion.div to animate the glow effect, making the progress bar look interactive.
The glow effect pulses in and out for added visual appeal using animate={{ opacity: [1, 0.8, 1], scale: [1, 1.05, 1] }}, creating a breathing effect.
Background Gradient Animation:

A gradient overlay fades in behind the progress bar with a blurred effect, adding depth and a polished look to the page. This background fades in with a subtle delay for smoothness.
Text Styling:

Increased the font size of the progress text to 24px, making it more prominent and easier to read.
textColor="#F4A300" ensures that the text inside the circle matches the golden color theme.
